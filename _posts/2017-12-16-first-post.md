First post! Waddup yall~

Blog's up and working thanks to a foolproof method of setting up: [http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/)

Perfect for someone like me who is a control freak (somewhat?) and wants to know what is actually happening in the code. Not great especially when you are a noob at HTML and CSS... story of my life.

In any case, try it!

Suitable for beginners.

I tried Bootstrap 4 earlier (also awesome for websites) but difficult to get a blog system up and going in the format I wanted (for me at least).

Jekyll's pretty intuitive, coupled with the fact that you can do posts in Markdown.

Exciting times ahead!
