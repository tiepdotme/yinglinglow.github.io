HAPPY NEW YEAR!!

Sooooo I was going to scrap with scrapy - this was a million times more painful than i imagined!!!

likely because i had no clue what i was doing. lol

here goes:

i had a tutorial from class (very similiar to this[http://mherman.org/blog/2012/11/05/scraping-web-pages-with-scrapy/] (http://mherman.org/blog/2012/11/05/scraping-web-pages-with-scrapy/) which i used to set up scrapy the proper way - but honestly, if you follow the commands (for build and run your web spiders) on the first page of scrapy at [https://scrapy.org/](https://scrapy.org/) you have your spider up and running in less than a minute with the example!

i should have tried this earlier :(

the tutorials on the herman website and of course on scrapy [https://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.16/intro/tutorial.html](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.16/intro/tutorial.html) teach you the fundamentals which are extremely useful, but hey, you gotta make things work first before you delve into the details, right? ...right?
