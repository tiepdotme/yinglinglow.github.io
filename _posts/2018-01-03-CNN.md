So before I actually jump in and do anything, I figured I better make sure i can actually run this thing on an AWS GPU LOL - [https://github.com/roatienza/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/master/Experiments/Tensorflow/GAN/dcgan_mnist.py](https://github.com/roatienza/Deep-Learning-Experiments/blob/master/Experiments/Tensorflow/GAN/dcgan_mnist.py) is a great place to start. easy to run, and comes along with an article explaining!

when this works i'd like to actually LEARN what's going on...

(in the meantime my 80,000 images load in the background, onto S3 - side note, I should have used scrapy to upload the images direct to S3* as well...!!! would have been faster than requests. i believe they use async libraries which allows you to make multiple requests at the same time... _kills myself_).

*Refer to this: [https://www.nickv.codes/blog/scrapy-uploading-image-files-to-amazon-s3/](https://www.nickv.codes/blog/scrapy-uploading-image-files-to-amazon-s3/)*


__SO what is going on with CNN???__

this is an actual code implementation, with notes to guide you along.

i recommend glancing through this first, then reading online summaries (or listening to youtube videos) to understand conceptually what is going on ([https://adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/](https://adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/) is amazing), before you jump back into the actual code below so you fully understand the steps:

then, move on to GAN:

AND here we go for a pluck and play:
