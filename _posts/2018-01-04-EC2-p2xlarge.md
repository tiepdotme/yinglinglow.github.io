SO life is tough and i had to fiddle around with this for a while before i could figure out which AMI to use! i swear i started at least 10 instances so far...

i'm not sure if it's because i'm stingy (i also chose t2.micro for FREE at the beginning hahahah) i just wanted to 'get my feet wet' as they all say right, but there were like a lot of cuda issues and stuff i think. i'm not even sure what was going wrong!

finally, i found THIS:

amazing stuff - step by step instructions!!

apparently some problems can be resolved by a reboot, and then reinstalling some stuff (lucky he included the installers!)

so...just use this guy man.

ami name: ami-ccba4ab4

as usual i was stingy and used the cheapest possible - c4.xlarge

*hint: it takes about 4 minutes to initialise so don't faint!!

i git cloned in, verified that my program can finally run (THANK GOD) - at the same speed as within my macbookpro LOL

hands trembling (very drama, i know) - i clicked to spin up an instance with GPU...

*p.s. - remember to terminate all your previous instances!!!!! if not you will be CHARGED.

p2.xlarge GPU IS RUNNING NOW HOLY COW

i can testify - it REALLY runs at 25 times the speed of a normal CPU...

this is miraculous

ok one tiny error:

_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable

look [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37604289/tkinter-tclerror-no-display-name-and-no-display-environment-variable) for an answer!!

i'm trying to add the below at the top of my script.
fingers crossed that this works!!!

```python
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')
```
