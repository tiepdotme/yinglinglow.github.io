problem - need to increase quality of predictions

try:
1) increasing number of images
    - 60,000?
        - aws s3
            - dl all images w scrapy to s3
            - resize them to a _28 bucket on s3

2) increasing number of epochs
    - 100,000?
    - have to learn to stop and continue (.fit?)
    - model.save()


p2.xlarge (2h15min)

- increase number of images
    call links from s3
    try to run locally
    run on gpu (speed x2)
