PROBLEM!

after running 10k epochs on 1,000 images - need to increase quality of predictions.

to try:
1) increasing number of images
    - 80,000
        - aws s3
            - download from current s3 bucket (to temporary files)
            - resize them to 28,28
            - upload to a separate _28 bucket on s3 (remember to create it in the same region at the ec2 you need to run your gpu on eventually!)

2) improve architecture of model
    - well this might take a while... lol

3) increasing number of epochs (to try at a later date!)
    - 100,000
    - have to learn to stop and continue
    - try this: https://machinelearningmastery.com/save-load-keras-deep-learning-models/

for the record:
10k epochs on 1,000 images on a p2.xlarge took 2h15min

to decrease the time taken, run on a GPU with twice the speed (NOT 2 GPUs!)
