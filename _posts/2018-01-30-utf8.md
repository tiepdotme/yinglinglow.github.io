If you're working with text/nlp stuff like spaCy/textacy, during your first time running it you might encounter errors relating to utf8. Below is how to deal with it:

and if you happen to STILL not be able to do it after completing this (like me), trying restarting your macbook.
it might have been that it didn't re-source the bash profile correctly, so.

it works! trust me.
