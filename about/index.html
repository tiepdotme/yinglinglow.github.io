    <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Ying Ling (颍玲) and I am excited about the endless possibilities of Machine Learning!
    
    I started learning Python in September 2017, and am currently enrolled in the Data Science 
    Immersive Course at General Assembly to build up my foundation :P</p>
    
<p>I like to tinker on the side with random projects - I've got a very basic Chatbot up,
    and some data analytics/visualisation going (check out my Github!).</p>

<p>Recently I'm wondering about all the crazy Machine Learning that's going on, and how we can 
    effectively translate these techniques into real life benefits (I am in the midst of an attempt 
    to generate logos with GAN!). In the meantime before I actually produce any tangible results, 
    the best value I can bring is to share my challenges with others.</p>

<p>And hence, this blog! It might be quite basic for now, but hey, everyone's got to start somewhere, 
    right? :P</p>

<p>If you have any questions/comments, please feel free to leave a note! I would greatly appreciate
    any pointers for improvement as well :)</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
