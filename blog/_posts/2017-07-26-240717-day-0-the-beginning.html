<p>SO, yesterday marked the first day I properly sat down and started learning programming - for real (I’ll touch a little more on this as we go along)!</p><p>Today I decide to start this blog, to help others in my shoes because let’s face it, it’s not easy.</p><p>What kind of value can I add? While it’s best to learn FROM experts, it’s always easier to learn WITH someone who’s at your level.</p><p>So treat me like a classmate - someone you can come to for help on random questions, but if you need an expert opinion, look for an expert ;) </p><p>Also, the lists of resources below are in no way exhaustive - just what I have stumbled upon in my search so far, which I hope will at least be helpful for another, embarking on the same journey :) All the best!</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>First off - <b>what programming language should I learn? </b></p><p>There’re a million languages out there - seriously. It depends on what you want to do&hellip; but I don’t even KNOW what I want to do.</p><p>So? The boyfriend recommended Python. Apparently it can do quite a bit of stuff and the language (syntax) is a lot cleaner/easier/intuitive&hellip; so here goes!</p><p>&mdash;</p><p><b>Where do I learn from?</b></p><p>Let’s hear it from the experts.</p><h2>Method 1: Online video tutorials</h2><p>I started previously listening to online tutorials on <b>Udemy</b> (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/">https://www.udemy.com/</a>) - in particular:</p><p><b>Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python by Jose Portilla </b>(<a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview">https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview</a>)</p><p>I waited for the discounts on Udemy to kick in before I bought it haha - I think it got it at like, SGD15. Singaporeans who have <b>Skillsfuture</b>, rejoice because you can also claim it:</p><p><a href="https://courses.skillsfuture.sg/content/portal/en/education_trainings/course_detail.Complete-Python-Bootcamp-Go-zero-hero-Python.html#fq=Course_Supp_Period_To_1%3A%5B2017-07-26T00%3A00%3A00Z%20TO%20*%5D&amp;q=Complete%20Python%20Bootcamp">https://courses.skillsfuture.sg/content/portal/en/education_trainings/course_detail.Complete-Python-Bootcamp-Go-zero-hero-Python.html#fq=Course_Supp_Period_To_1%3A%5B2017-07-26T00%3A00%3A00Z%20TO%20*%5D&amp;q=Complete%20Python%20Bootcamp</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Pros - affordable, own time own target, it’s a step by step guide, you can see from the video <i>exactly</i> what is being done.</p><p>Cons - you have to have incredible self discipline to listen regularly, and practice (I don’t)</p><p><br/></p><h2>Method 2: Bootcamps</h2><p><b>General Assembly</b></p><p>A fair bit of hype around this, courses sell like hotcakes I heard! In any case, it was too expensive for me (Singaporeans, again there are subsidies I believe!) and I wasn’t quite sure if I was ready to commit/ if I was ready at all!</p><p><a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education?format=classes-workshops">https://generalassemb.ly/education?format=classes-workshops</a><br/></p><p><b>TechLadies</b></p><p>For the ladies - more affordable, local (I believe) but limited slots as well. BUT what I love about it is, there’s plenty of open information available for pre-bootcamp!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/TechLadies/prebootcamp-workshops-2017">https://github.com/TechLadies/prebootcamp-workshops-2017</a><br/></p><p>I found it really helpful, and you will see what I do with this in the next few days - stay tuned!</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>In the meantime, while I was going around scraping for information, I peeped around some websites, joined some Groups for support, and inspiration! To be frank the realisation really hit then - “you are not alone~”</p><p>Really, just join a couple of the groups and you’ll be surprised at how much sharing there is going on.</p><p>Anyhow, go forth and explore, and I’ll see you guys tomorrow as we officially kick off the journey and start coding!</p><p><a href="https://engineers.sg/">https://engineers.sg/</a><br/></p><p><a href="https://webuild.sg/">https://webuild.sg/</a><br/></p><p><a href="https://leanincircles.org/circle/women-in-tech-sg">https://leanincircles.org/circle/women-in-tech-sg</a><br/></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pmetnetwork/">https://www.facebook.com/pmetnetwork/</a><br/></p><p><a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/">https://www.womenwhocode.com/</a><br/></p>
