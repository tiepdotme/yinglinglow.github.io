SO, yesterday marked the first day I properly sat down and started learning programming - for real (I’ll touch a little more on this as we go along)!Today I decide to start this blog, to help others in my shoes because let’s face it, it’s not easy.What kind of value can I add? While it’s best to learn FROM experts, it’s always easier to learn WITH someone who’s at your level.So treat me like a classmate - someone you can come to for help on random questions, but if you need an expert opinion, look for an expert ;) Also, the lists of resources below are in no way exhaustive - just what I have stumbled upon in my search so far, which I hope will at least be helpful for another, embarking on the same journey :) All the best!—First off - what programming language should I learn? There’re a million languages out there - seriously. It depends on what you want to do… but I don’t even KNOW what I want to do.So? The boyfriend recommended Python. Apparently it can do quite a bit of stuff and the language (syntax) is a lot cleaner/easier/intuitive… so here goes!—Where do I learn from?Let’s hear it from the experts.Method 1: Online video tutorialsI started previously listening to online tutorials on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/) - in particular:Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python by Jose Portilla (https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview)I waited for the discounts on Udemy to kick in before I bought it haha - I think it got it at like, SGD15. Singaporeans who have Skillsfuture, rejoice because you can also claim it:https://courses.skillsfuture.sg/content/portal/en/education_trainings/course_detail.Complete-Python-Bootcamp-Go-zero-hero-Python.html#fq=Course_Supp_Period_To_1%3A%5B2017-07-26T00%3A00%3A00Z%20TO%20*%5D&q=Complete%20Python%20BootcampPros - affordable, own time own target, it’s a step by step guide, you can see from the video exactly what is being done.Cons - you have to have incredible self discipline to listen regularly, and practice (I don’t)Method 2: BootcampsGeneral AssemblyA fair bit of hype around this, courses sell like hotcakes I heard! In any case, it was too expensive for me (Singaporeans, again there are subsidies I believe!) and I wasn’t quite sure if I was ready to commit/ if I was ready at all!https://generalassemb.ly/education?format=classes-workshopsTechLadiesFor the ladies - more affordable, local (I believe) but limited slots as well. BUT what I love about it is, there’s plenty of open information available for pre-bootcamp!https://github.com/TechLadies/prebootcamp-workshops-2017I found it really helpful, and you will see what I do with this in the next few days - stay tuned!—In the meantime, while I was going around scraping for information, I peeped around some websites, joined some Groups for support, and inspiration! To be frank the realisation really hit then - “you are not alone~”Really, just join a couple of the groups and you’ll be surprised at how much sharing there is going on.Anyhow, go forth and explore, and I’ll see you guys tomorrow as we officially kick off the journey and start coding!https://engineers.sg/https://webuild.sg/https://leanincircles.org/circle/women-in-tech-sghttps://www.facebook.com/pmetnetwork/https://www.womenwhocode.com/
