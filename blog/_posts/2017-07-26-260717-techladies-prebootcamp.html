<p>Life’s a breeze (compared to the crime scene from yesterday) - I’m following the first prebootcamp from TechLadies, and all’s fine and dandy for now. The video and the Github, instructions, etc, everything’s amazing - kudos to them!</p><p><a href="https://github.com/TechLadies/prebootcamp-workshops-2017">https://github.com/TechLadies/prebootcamp-workshops-2017</a><br/></p><p>That mighttt also be because I did have some teeny tiny bit of HTML experience (from like, 15 years ago, you know, when having your own online blog was so cool). Yes, we were covering HTML and CSS in the prebootcamp.</p><p>Lovely.</p><p>We’ll see how I die tomorrow as we jump into the fundamentals of Ruby. <i>shudders</i></p>
