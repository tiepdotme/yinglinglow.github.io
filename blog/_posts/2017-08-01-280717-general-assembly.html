<p>So&hellip; I kind of stopped the tutorial on TechLadies - for good reason!</p><p>It is amazing, great, and I totally would have completed it if not for the fact that I went to sign up for the Data Immersive Bootcamp by General Assembly (<a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive">https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive</a>) !!</p><p>Now now, nothing is confirmed yet but I am happy to say that on Thursday I sent in my application. Immediately on Friday I received a call from the admissions officer (!) anddd lo and behold they came back with a request to complete an assignment over the weekend (yes, this was what I have been busy with)!</p><p>I submitted my application, and there will be an interview tomorrow! </p><p>Keep you guys updated - fingers crossed!</p><p>In the meantime it’s back to the Udemy Python (zero to hero) course (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview">https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview</a>) to brush up on my non-existent Python skills.</p>
