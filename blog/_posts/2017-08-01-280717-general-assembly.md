So… I kind of stopped the tutorial on TechLadies - for good reason!It is amazing, great, and I totally would have completed it if not for the fact that I went to sign up for the Data Immersive Bootcamp by General Assembly (https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive) !!Now now, nothing is confirmed yet but I am happy to say that on Thursday I sent in my application. Immediately on Friday I received a call from the admissions officer (!) anddd lo and behold they came back with a request to complete an assignment over the weekend (yes, this was what I have been busy with)!I submitted my application, and there will be an interview tomorrow! Keep you guys updated - fingers crossed!In the meantime it’s back to the Udemy Python (zero to hero) course (https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) to brush up on my non-existent Python skills.
