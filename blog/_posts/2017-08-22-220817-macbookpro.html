<p>Today is the day I own my first ever Macbook!! Yes, well, I am backward like that lol - I am the embodiment of what they call a laggard.</p>

<p>And hence I also got the opportunity to install Python from scratch! While some places recommend the Anaconda package for easy installation (apparently it combines all the necessary tools you generally need), on influence I decided to follow this guide and do a native Python install. Follow at your own risk! (aka only do this if you have a guardian angel next to you giving you step by step instructions to remedy any of your mistakes lol.)</p>
