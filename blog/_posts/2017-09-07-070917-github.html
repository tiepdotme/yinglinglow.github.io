<p>soooo today i am getting around to cleaning up my Github! in a terrible mess really. what prompted me to do so was because yesterday i went for a data gathering sort of stuff, gave my Github username to get access, and i was sooo embarrassed at how messy and unprofessional it was!</p><p>in any case, i have REMEDIED THAT TODAY hah. also getting my shit together so that i can get around to building up my portfolio.</p><p>it’s going to be a long journey, but baby steps! nobody ever accomplished anything great in one day, right? &hellip;right?</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>also since I have managed to scrap by all the pre-course required for GA, i am busying myself with some SQL in the meantime, apparently it’s pretty important and useful when using it in Pandas in Python anyways.</p><p>maybe someday when i get my head around the basics of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) properly, that’s when i can progress to some machine learning&hellip; i look forward to that day LOL.</p><p>in the meantime, if anyone has any handy tips on data cleaning and EDA please drop me a note and i would be eternally grateful.</p><p>&mdash;</p><p>in other news, the guys from DataKind are doing some pretty cool work here in Singapore - check them out!</p><p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataKind-SG/">https://www.meetup.com/DataKind-SG/</a><br/></p>
