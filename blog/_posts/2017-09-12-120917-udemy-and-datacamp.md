completed the Udemy python course: zero to hero today!not too bad - and now i’m progressing to the next course Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp - hope its fun!what i’ve found pretty useful so far is Datacamp’s Importing & Managing Financial Data in Python - it’s a paid course (but since i’ve access through GA, why not? haha)for those who are not subscribed, try this on Datacamp instead: Kaggle Python Tutorial on Machine Learning. i’m just barely scraped the surface on this, but pretty interesting so far!—my two cents: udemy’s good for learning the theory, datacamp’s pretty good at getting some insights into practical usage! a combination of both is important!
