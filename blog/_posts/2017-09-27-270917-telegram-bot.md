wowow would you look at that nearly 2 weeks flew by just like that!what have i been busy with?well, i am proud to say i have officially kickstarted my first telegram bot project!! not an easy task i assure you and i am still struggling to get it to work properly.however i am halfway(?) there and hopefully it works ok soon…!!ok maybe less than halfway cause i cheated and have no yet uploaded it onto heroku - still working locally from my laptop.https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-telegram-bot-using-python-part-1-goi5fncayI think the above link was extremely helpful in my process of creating the bot. no doubt there was alot more struggling before i even understood what was going on, it helped. hahaall the best to yall embarking on this journey!—hmm maybe i should create my own telegram bot tutorial for dummies someday. haha
