<p>I have been getting questions on this, so here is a compilation of free/affordable resources you can try to learn Python online from, within the context of Data Science:</p><p><b>Udemy</b></p><p><i>Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python<br/>Jose Portilla</i><br/>Buy it when it is on offer and it should cost only $15SGD. You can claim this from Skillsfuture if you are Singaporean!</p><p><i>Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp<br/>Jose Portilla</i></p><p>same as above</p><p><br/></p><p><i>Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python &amp; R In Data Science<br/> Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves</i><br/></p><p>Haven’t tried this personally but heard good review from a friend - also $15/$18 when on offer</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Datacamp</b></p><p><i>Kaggle Python Tutorial on Machine Learning</i></p><p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learning">https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learning</a><br/></p><p>There are just a few free courses on Datacamp, feel free to explore, but this was pretty fun</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Udacity</b></p><p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses/all">https://www.udacity.com/courses/all</a><br/></p><p>I am still in the midst of figuring this out, but apparently if you go into the individual courses some of them are free, even though they are part of the nanodegree (which as a whole is not free)</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Dataquest</b></p><p>Haven’t tried this personally, but seems like there are some basic courses for free as well according to a friend</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Coursera</b></p><p>Also still trying to figure this out, but apparently materials are free. You only pay for graded assignments and certification</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Codecademy</b></p><p>For basics</p><p><br/></p><p>&mdash;</p><p><br/></p><p>For the guys who have learnt and want to test your skills, I’d suggest giving the below a try. Practice makes perfect!</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Project Euler</b></p><p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/">https://projecteuler.net/</a><br/></p><p><b>Reddit Daily Programmer</b></p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/">https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/</a><br/></p><p><b>Kaggle</b></p><p><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">https://www.kaggle.com/</a><br/></p><p>&mdash;</p><p><br/></p><p>For those who want to make your code more Pythonic:</p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/JeffPaine/6213790">https://gist.github.com/JeffPaine/6213790</a><br/></p><p><a href="http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html">http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html</a><br/></p><p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/</a> (specific to docstrings)<br/></p>
