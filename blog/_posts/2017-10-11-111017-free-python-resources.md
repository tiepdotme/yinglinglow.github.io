I have been getting questions on this, so here is a compilation of free/affordable resources you can try to learn Python online from, within the context of Data Science:UdemyComplete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in PythonJose PortillaBuy it when it is on offer and it should cost only $15SGD. You can claim this from Skillsfuture if you are Singaporean!Python for Data Science and Machine Learning BootcampJose Portillasame as aboveMachine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de PontevesHaven’t tried this personally but heard good review from a friend - also $15/$18 when on offerDatacampKaggle Python Tutorial on Machine Learninghttps://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/kaggle-python-tutorial-on-machine-learningThere are just a few free courses on Datacamp, feel free to explore, but this was pretty funUdacityhttps://www.udacity.com/courses/allI am still in the midst of figuring this out, but apparently if you go into the individual courses some of them are free, even though they are part of the nanodegree (which as a whole is not free)DataquestHaven’t tried this personally, but seems like there are some basic courses for free as well according to a friendCourseraAlso still trying to figure this out, but apparently materials are free. You only pay for graded assignments and certificationCodecademyFor basics—For the guys who have learnt and want to test your skills, I’d suggest giving the below a try.
