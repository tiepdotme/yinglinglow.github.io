<p>so i’ve been away for awhile - been busy with the first three weeks of GA (already 2 projects submitted!) and keeping my social life alive (it is possible, yes).</p><p>so far it’s been good and plenty of learning (not just from the teacher but also fellow classmates!), but i do look forward to the machine learning bits!!</p><p>exciting stuff.</p><p>i went to google how to access free machine learning courses (because for the death of me i couldnt figure out how to get to the free coursera bits) and this seemed pretty good: <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-single-machine-learning-course-on-the-internet-ranked-by-your-reviews-3c4a7b8026c0">https://medium.freecodecamp.org/every-single-machine-learning-course-on-the-internet-ranked-by-your-reviews-3c4a7b8026c0</a></p><p><br/></p><p>just viewed the intro video of this, and i am hooked!! try it</p><p><a href="https://www.class-central.com/mooc/398/coursera-neural-networks-for-machine-learning">https://www.class-central.com/mooc/398/coursera-neural-networks-for-machine-learning</a><br/></p><p>update: NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED - or, uninitialised. i am halfway through lecture and and already am thanking the gods i had i tiny bit of exposure to sigmoid functions in the previous udemy course&hellip;</p>
