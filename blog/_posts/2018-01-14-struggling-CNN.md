as i struggle to get my act together, this has been immensely helpful in piecing things together

in particular, all the different names for same items, OR similar names for different items were killing me.

so, if you ever have questions, here were a couple of helpful answers i found:

https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-number-of-filters-in-a-convolution-layer-convey-How-does-this-number-effect-the-performance-or-quality-of-the-architecture

basic tutorials really helped too:

https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros

http://cv-tricks.com/tensorflow-tutorial/training-convolutional-neural-network-for-image-classification/

https://pythonprogramming.net/tensorflow-neural-network-session-machine-learning-tutorial/?completed=/tensorflow-deep-neural-network-machine-learning-tutorial/

python programming was AMAZING.
just saying.

if anyone ever wants to use pytorch instead of tensorflow (personally i would love to try pytorch!!)
