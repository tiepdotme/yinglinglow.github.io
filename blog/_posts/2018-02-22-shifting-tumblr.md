THIS IS AMAZING JEKYLL IS INCREDIBLE

for anyone considering to move from tumblr to jekyll, this gets ALL your posts in like, in a second. 

[http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/tumblr/](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/tumblr/)

amazing stuff. you do need ruby and `sudo gem install jekyll-import` though

love it.

if you ever get an error, remember to check your URL - there shouldn't be a '/' at the end!

for the guys who use markdown in your usual blog posts (like me), still import using html! i find that it preserves the paragraphing and all better.
