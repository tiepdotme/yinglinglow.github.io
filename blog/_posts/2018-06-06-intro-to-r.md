In a strange twist of fate I have been tasked to introduce my overseas colleagues to R. LOL

I shall sneak some python bits in.

Before you begin, ask questions. 

Ask if they have heard of R before.
Ask if there is any reason anyone has asked them to learn about R.
Ask what tools they are currently using, and what are their pain points.

From here you can establish a starting point, and an end point.
What knowledge should they walk away with?

__What is R?__
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It is free.
It is open source - meaning people can modify and share the source code. Think of it as a public collaboration.

__What isn't R?__
R is not a general programming language - it has its roots in statistics. To do more than statistics like building a website, other tools like Python will be better choice.

__Why R?__
R can allow you to store a series of data manipulation steps in a script, and re-apply it across similar data.
It can create data tables, but also graphs for visualisation.

__Why not R?__
It can appear difficult to learn at first.

__Why not VBA/Excel?__
VBA is only used within Excel/Access.
Excel is slow/unable to handle large datasets.
Reproduction of previously conducted analyses on new datasets is not easy.

__Where can I get R?__
Install it at http://cran.r-project.org/
Also install R Studio from http://www.rstudio.com/ which provides a user friendly environment to work in.

__How do I learn more about R?__
https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-scratch/

A quick scroll reveals the basic functions, to the more complex machine capabilities of R.
For a more in depth tutorial to begin learning from scratch, I would suggest Google! Find a blog/video/book that you are most comfortable with - everyone has a different learning style!

__Alternatives to R?__
Python! Highly recommended for readability and ability to extend to general programming ;)
It can do 95% of what R can do (but perhaps in a more clunky manner).
