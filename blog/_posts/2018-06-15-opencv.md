Ok - this guy has already built an app for real-time object recognition, see here: https://github.com/datitran/object_detector_app

You can play around with it for fun!

However, as my purpose is quite different, I shall attempt to build my own video detection thingy based on the Tensorflow API (the frozen model first, then we shall see if I want to unfreeze the top layers and train it) LOL

Not going to be easy! First things first... how do I get my video into frames?

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture('alligator_video.mp4') # you can change it to your video file

while(cap.isOpened()):
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    if ret == True:
        cv2.imshow('frame', frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    else:
        break
            
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

```

I'm just trying to get it to show each frame of the video for now... but somehow my video file can't close at cap.release() which is strange. Guess I have to slowly learn from scratch and figure it out.

OpenCV, here I come!

On a side note, if anyone has any trouble installing opencv on python 3 (mine kept installing on python 2.7 and pip3 didn't work), here's what I used (thanks to my trusty personal advisor): `python3 -m pip install opencv-python`

And if anyone is ever curious what `-m` means: https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html
