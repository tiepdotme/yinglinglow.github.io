Because I am somehow very lazy to move my ass this week to do actual coding - let's read some articles instead LOL

Really good analogy and hiring the right team for the job is so important.

interesting perspective on Agile and Analytics:

Writing Acceptance Criteria I think will be hugely beneficial.


just as how I am just beginning to write tests! though I am so much slower at coding now, the quality of work that comes out is much better I must say - much cleaner and more organised code.

This tutorial looks amazing:

I think it'd be really helpful for those new to Tensorflow (like me) - I am just too lazy to read and process everything now LOL

Actually, let me just go take a nap now LOL.

kthxbye
