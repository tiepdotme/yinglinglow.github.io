Also, another lie I use to tell myself that I am not lazy is that my Macbook has been sent for repair! Meaning I have to use Windows even at home... so I can't like, get in the mood for programming.
LOL #indenial

let's see if I am less lazy next week lol

(But I really do miss my Mac I feel lost without it LOL)
