So I have existing repositories in github, what do I do?

I `git clone` them into my computer!

But now... I've been using the HTTPS protocol all my life (I think - since I don't have any SSH keys!)

What's the difference? Why should I change? Read here: https://medium.com/@haydar_ai/learning-how-to-git-using-ssh-instead-of-https-91f09cff72de

Now, if you had supplied a passphrase (I did) - it stills asks you everytime you `git clone`. To solve that, look at the fourth answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21095054/ssh-key-still-asking-for-password-and-passphrase

Basically it says:

```bash
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add -A
```

Create (or edit if it exists) the following ~/.ssh/config file:

```
Host *
  UseKeychain yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

tada! life is good.
