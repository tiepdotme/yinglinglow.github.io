Now, how do I go about doing this?

Honestly, I am so lazy it's not even funny. If there is any free API or library that can do this... PLEASE TELL ME.

Top of the list to try out is csvlink: https://github.com/dedupeio/csvdedupe

I might try out https://www.rosette.com/capability/name-matching/ but I think it will start costing money soon!

Otherwise... #manualit

I guess https://github.com/psolin/cleanco helps?

https://spacy.io/usage/vectors-similarity?

https://github.com/rliebz/whoswho???

(p.s. - not quite mentioning the typical levenshtein since everyone's talking about it already)


Also, lazy me will try it out first before searching for more stuff LOL
