So, I've been getting some questions on what I would recommend for people who are interested in picking up programming lanaguages like Python, and learning about Data Science, Machine Learning, etc.

So I've come up with a little FAQ below - let me know if you have more questions!

Of course, all this I write now is in hindsight. If you prefer to read about it from my perspective back then when I started (very different perspective I assure you), check out the link below and scroll all the way to the very first blog post:

Enjoy and all the best in your journey :)

__I saw that you took courses on General Assembly and also online courses on Datacamp. Which would you recommend more?__

If you are just dabbling around with Python as a start, I'd recommend 'Python Zero to Hero' on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) as an introduction to Python (NOT data science focused). It costs around $15 USD when on sale (last I checked!). Singaporeans, you can claim it via Skillsfuture. There are also other online courses if you want to explore Python for Data Science. 

If you are already sure about going into Data Science and want to jump right in, then go for General Assembly. It is quite broad in coverage (and comes with Datacamp access, for those who are interested) but it is a significant investment. The course is 3 months, full time, and costs around $13,000 USD. For Singaporeans, it costs ~$6k after government subsidy but you MUST get a Python/Data Science role to qualify for the subsidy.


__How much knowledge did you have before going for the course?__
I had zero knowledge in programming two months before the course started (only vveryyyy basic html). I did a an online Udemy course in Python (https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview) and had some help (ok, a LOT of help) from my friend who knows coding, before starting the GA course. The pre-course work they assigned was helpful as preparation too.


__Was it a steep learning curve?__
As with everything in life, if you don't have background in something and you start learning it from scratch, it is going to be difficult. But if you are determined, persistent, and consistent, you will learn new things every day and you will improve. And in tech, you will HAVE to keep learning for the rest of your life - the speed of change is insane! #lifelonglearning lol


__What did the course help you in?__
The practical experience from projects were valuable, so that you can actually apply the code you learnt!

Syllabus was quite a good coverage of topics (in terms of breadth), but on top of that it is really important to read up and practice outside of class for depth, and to also explore other topics!

What we learn in class is a good starting point to cover the basics so that it is much easier for self-study in the future.

Most importantly, because you are learning as a class, you are learning from your classmates - there are so many ways to code, to tackle a problem. Really eye-opening. Even after the course has ended, these are the people who will be your (techy) support group outside of work.


__How did you get your first job after General Assembly?__
I was actively applying to jobs since the beginning of the course. Apply early! Don't wait until the last minute. It takes months to find a job! If you are concerned about not having sufficient skills to pass the interview - well, my mindset was that going for interviews will exactly teach you what skills you are lacking in and THEN you know what skills to focus on picking up.

As to how I actually secured the job - I think the key contributing factors were:
1) Filling up my CV/ Linkedin with relevant skillsets and experience - very important! Otherwise how would anyone know what knowledge/experience/skills you have? And if you have no experience - do some side projects and write them in! It doesn't have to be professional experience when you are starting out.

2) Doing up my Github - again, very important. Showcase your projects, and be ready to explain how you did it! 

3) GO FOR INTERVIEWS - I was exploring many types of roles (not necessarily just those with the 'Data Scientist' titles), and I was also open to contract roles (my first job was a contract role).

4) Be ready to explain what you know, what you don't know (be honest! DON'T oversell), be keen to learn.

Of course, a lot of other things had to come together nicely for it to work - but do what you can on the things you can control to maximise your chances.
