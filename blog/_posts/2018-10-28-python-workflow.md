before i jump in -

Python 3.7.1 is out! upgrade for fun laughter peace and joy hoho: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/

Now, setting up a Python environment/workflow is painful. For me anyway, because I am still learning and figuring out how to even just make stuff work...! Also, because I have a really bad memory lol

There are a couple of good guides out there, check them out:

2) https://jacobian.org/writing/python-environment-2018/

But here's my own hoho

1) At home: macOS + I can do whatever I want/ install any packages I want (read: pytest)

2) At work: Windows + I can't do... a lot of stuff (read: have to use unittest)

so, i have created the below two starter templates!
