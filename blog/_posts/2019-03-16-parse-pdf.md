this is pretty sick (and accurate): parse your pdfs (with tables) using Tabula!!!

https://pypi.org/project/tabula-py/

i would first split the PDF into its individual pages, then use tabula on the required pages (it can parse multiple tables too!!)

__To split your pdf into individual pages:__

```python

from PyPDF2 import PdfFileWriter, PdfFileReader

"""This outputs each selected page as a separate PDF page, with the page number as a prefix."""

dir_path = 'Desktop/abc/'
filename = 'abc.pdf'
pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(open(dir_path + filename, 'rb'))

for i in range(start_page, end_page):
    output = PdfFileWriter()
    output.addPage(pdf_reader.getPage(i-1))
    output_filepath = dir_path + str(i) + '_' + filename
    with open(output_filepath, 'wb') as outputStream:
        output.write(outputStream)

```

__To extract text from your single pdf page:__

```python 

from PyPDF2 import PdfFileWriter, PdfFileReader

filename = 'abc.pdf'
pdf_reader = PdfFileReader(open(filename, 'rb'))
pageObj = pdf_reader.getPage(0)
text = pageObj.extractText()
text = text.replace('\n', '').replace('\t', '')

```

__To extract a single table from your single pdf page:__

```python

import tabula

pdf_filepath = '1_abc.pdf'
df = tabula.read_pdf(pdf_filepath)

```

__To extract multiple tables from your single pdf page:__

```python

import tabula

pdf_filepath = '1_abc.pdf'
df = tabula.read_pdf(pdf_filepath, multiple_tables=True)

```

too amazing - tabula parses tables almost perfectly!
