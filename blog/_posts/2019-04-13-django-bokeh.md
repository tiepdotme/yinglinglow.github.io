some pretty sick stuff going on here!!

for a beginner in Django, Bokeh, Bootstrap and CSS (all me) - to be able to draw this up in a couple of hours (mostly copying and pasting stuff luh, plus fake data and everything, you get the drift lol) = MINDBLOWN.

for me anyways. lol

now i can go about the day feeling happy. whee~

of course couldn't have done it without tutorial so - this is pretty amazing: https://hackernoon.com/integrating-bokeh-visualisations-into-django-projects-a1c01a16b67a

some parts of his code can't be copied and pasted (making me lazy to do the side bar lol) - but if you need anything, check out my code here: https://github.com/yinglinglow/proj_django_api
