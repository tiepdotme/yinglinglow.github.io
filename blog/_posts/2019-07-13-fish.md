new shell!

fish!

welcome - we'll see how we fare...

apparently it's 'better' than bash? hahaha

i guess the only two things that make the most difference for me (for now) is the autocomplete and it how it cycles through the previous commands (not by order executed by guessing what you want to execute i think...!!!)

check it out here: https://fishshell.com

edit: so... if bash is used in all unix servers... might be a better idea to stick to bash whoops lol in case i forget all the commands when i actually need to use bash!!
