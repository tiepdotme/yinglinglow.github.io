Nearly two months since my last post... life happens, and crazy happened. in any case...

---

so, i JUST started using cookie-cutter (i know, i know, LATE) and it's GREAT

because i still don't know what the heck is going on half the time, i just use a very basic one, cookiecutter-pypackage-minimal

---

what you can do after that is, if your repo is already set up on some git system (e.g. github), YOU CAN DISTRIBUTE YOUR CODE ACROSS TEAMS!!!

just use pip install:

```python

pip install git+https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter

```

still a lot to figure out but... good start? lol
