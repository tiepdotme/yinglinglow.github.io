so i only knew of how to store my authentication details in environment variables (see here: https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html)

until NOW! my dear colleague has recommended vaultproject (check them out here: vaultproject.io) 

havent had the chance to try it out yet but sharing the link here for everyone!!
