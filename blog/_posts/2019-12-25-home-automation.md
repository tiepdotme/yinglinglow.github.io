for all interested in home automation, home assistant is pretty sick: https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/

pretty sick! steps are pretty straightforward...?

at least i (very luckily) did not bump into any problems along the way (except for figuring out how to properly plug the sd card into the raspberry pi... #halp)

pro-tip: plug in a hdmi cable to your raspberry pi into the tv to see the progress of the installation...!!!
