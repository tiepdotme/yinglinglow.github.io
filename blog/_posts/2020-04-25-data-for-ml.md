how do you collect data...?

how do you detect data drift, how do you regularly assess performance of the algorithm?

to prove that it works is one thing, to prove that it will not fail requires far greater effort.

---

after you deploy your algorithm, how do you stay close to it

how do you push updates to it?

how can you update the software?

plug in a memory card and reboot...?

why can't/shouldn't it be connected...?
