    <h1>Hi there!</h1>

<p>
    <b>Beginner to Python/ Data Science?</b><br><br>
    Check out my <a href="https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/tree/master/Beginner%20Python%20Cheatsheet">Python Cheatsheet</a>!
    It is a reference list of basic Python code, mostly in the context of Data Science and (just a little) Machine Learning.
    Most of this will be quite basic, likely most valuable for beginner individuals just doing a quick Google to figure something out. 
    It's work in progress, so do pardon missing bits and pieces.

    <b>Want to build a Telegram Chatbot?</b><br><br>
    Feel free to check out my (very basic) Telegram chatbot code on <a href="https://github.com/yinglinglow/sgparkingbot">my Github</a>.
    I haven't documented it very nicely for now <i>*gulps</i>* but feel free to ask if you have 
    any questions! It's free hosting on Heroku by the way hehe ;) Talk to <b>SGParkingBot</b> on Telegram to try it out!!

<p>
    <b>Curious to explore Deep Learning?</b><br><br>
    Check out <a href="https://yinglinglow.github.io/blog/">my blog posts</a> on my 
    journey to generate images (brand logos, in particular) using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks). Bear with me for the messy posts right now,
    I am just jotting down things as I go along - one day I will prettify it into a legit tutorial (hopefully?)
