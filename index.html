    <h1>Hi there!</h1>

<p>
    <b>Beginner to Python/ Data Science?</b><br><br>
    Check out my <a href="https://github.com/yinglinglow/Python/tree/master/Beginner_Python_Cheatsheet">Python Cheatsheet</a>!
    It is a reference list of basic Python code, mostly in the context of Data Science and (just a little) Machine Learning.
    Most of this will be quite basic, likely most valuable for beginner individuals just doing a quick Google to figure something out. 
    It's work in progress, so do pardon missing bits and pieces.<br><br>
    I just did an introductory post on k-Means <a href="https://www.yinglinglow.com/blog/2018/02/28/kmeans">here</a> as well if anyone is interested! 
    Alternatively if you do have topics you want to read about, comment on any of my blog posts/message me on Linkedin and let me know ;)

    <b>Want to build a Telegram Chatbot?</b><br><br>
    Feel free to check out my (very basic) Telegram chatbot code on <a href="https://github.com/yinglinglow/sgparkingbot">my Github</a>.
    I haven't documented it very nicely for now <i>*gulps</i>* but feel free to ask if you have 
    any questions! It's free hosting on Heroku by the way hehe ;) Talk to <b>SGParkingBot</b> on Telegram to try it out!!

    <b>Curious to explore Deep Learning?</b><br><br>
    Check out my posts on <a href="https://www.yinglinglow.com/blog/2018/02/13/GAN-walkthrough">A Beginner's Guide To GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)</a> 
    for an introduction to GANs, as well as a walkthrough of how exactly to generate your own images (brand logos, in particular).

    <b>Interested in my Data Science Journey?</b><br><br>
    I've compiled a list of FAQ <a href='https://www.yinglinglow.com/blog/2018/09/22/journey'>here</a> - feel free to ask me any more questions!
    I've also got my blog <a href="https://www.yinglinglow.com/blog/">right here</a> which tracks my on-going journey. Bear with me for the messy posts, I am literally 
    just jotting down things as I go along. More often than not, these are just little snippets of code or tutorials that I've found
    to be helpful.

    <b>Want to build your own smart home?</b><br><br>
    I'm not the most tech-savvy person on earth, but there is some beautiful technology I would like to incorporate into my
    life, and future home (if possible)! Check them out <a href="https://www.yinglinglow.com/news/">here</a>.
