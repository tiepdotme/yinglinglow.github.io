Can I say that this post is completely irrelevant to any tech news whatsoever?

Ok let me try to make this at least a little techy:

__Wifi__

If you are in Seoul for just a short holiday and don't really need the internet often, I'd argue that it is not necessary to pay more for a data plan here. Most of the restaurants or even some shops offer free wifi! Same at train stations, and large department stores as well. So if you're on a budget and are willing to put up with intermittent breaks without wifi - you don't need to get a data plan there!

Be sure to download your offline maps and all before you leave any wifi zone!

on to the main point of this post: FOOD!

I just need to share this because honestly, we found it not so easy to find updated blogs in 2018 about what food to eat...

I did not see these blogs before I went, unfortunately: 

https://www.willflyforfood.net/2017/12/30/korean-food-guide-22-must-eat-restaurants-in-seoul-south-korea/#jung

https://www.mysuitcasejourneys.com/2016/12/09/seoul-food-guide/#

Also, I stayed at Myeongdong (shoutout to L7! book early and it is more affordable. So convenient!)so if you are staying there too, you'll find this list especially helpful - I hope!


If you are in Seoul and are wondering what to eat, check out my list below~

__1. Gosame (MUST EAT)__ aka Gosami

Address: 38 Yonsei-ro 7an-gil, Sinchon-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul, South Korea

Nearest train station: Sinchon

This place is amazing - the fish is crazy fresh, tender, grilled to perfection. I kid you not. Life changing. You HAVE to eat the fish. Squid was not too impressive somehow (perhaps we were unlucky?)


__2. Yukjeon Sikdang (MUST EAT)__

Address: 16, Nangye-ro 30-gil, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 02586, South Korea

Nearest train station: Sinseoldong

Another mind blowing place - best pork BBQ ever. Seriously, the pork is good quality, huge chunks, and great service.


__3. Myeongdong Gyoza__

Address: 29 Myeongdong 10-gil, Myeongdong 2(i)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea

Nearest train station: Myeongdong

Opens daily, 1030am to 930pm

https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294197-d1196214-Reviews-Myeongdong_Kyoja_Main-Seoul.html

https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/528509387508254/myeondong-kyoja/

This place grows on you. It's not mind blowing from the start, but it's good comfort food and we keep going back... dumplings are good, kimchi is really good (very garlicky) and friends love the buckwheat noodle. 


__4. Jaedong Sundubu__

Address: 6 Bukchon-ro 2-gil, Gahoe-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, South Korea

Nearest train station: Anguk

Opens daily (closed on public holidays I believe!), 11.30am - 3.30pm, 4.30pm - 10pm

https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294197-d6960479-Reviews-Jaedong_Sundubu-Seoul.html

https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/1792237427725045/jaedong-sundubu/

Pure comfort food - sundubu which is soft tofu stew was tasty. This is a traditional sort of korean restaurant. Help yourselves to the free refill of side dishes, take only what you can finish!


__5. Hyung Nim Jeo Yo__

Address: 36, Eoulmadang-ro, Mapo-gu | 1f 2f, Seoul 04053, South Korea

Nearest train station: Hongik University

https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294197-d4073259-Reviews-Hyung_Nim_Jeo_Yo-Seoul.html

Beef bbq that is yummy and affordable - other places tend to be quite pricey. If we want beef bbq, this is the place to go! Self service cooking.


__6. Shim Seun Tang__ aka Simpson Tang

Address: 2-3 Myeongdong 2(i)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea

Nearest train station: Myeongdong

https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294197-d11773600-Reviews-Simseuntang-Seoul.html

https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/1606393136123718/


Yummy army stew! Two person portion with two noodles fed four of us, including a pan of spicy stir-fried pork.


__7. Shake Shack__

Address: 18-12 Gwanghui-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea

Nearest train station: Dongdaemun

https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Restaurant_Review-g294197-d12639413-Reviews-Shake_Shack_Doota-Seoul.html

https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/495082400874953/shake-shack/


If your home country doesn't have Shake Shack, try this out! The burgers are really juicy and yummy. Take the basic burger, make it a double patty. Yum.


__8. Premium Jjimdak__

Address: 54-1 Myeong-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea

Nearest train station: Myeongdong

https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/1022470194/premium-jjimdak/

Sounds dodgy but the soy sauce chicken stew was actually really good! Quality ingredients, and also not excessively spicy. We didn't get to try Bongchu Jjimdak or Andong Jjimdak, but if you want to, go for it!

__Bonus: Grilled chicken skewer and fishcake soup__

Nearest train station: Ewha Women's University Exit 2

When you come out of exit 2, follow where everyone is walking (I believe, make a left?) to the main street towards Ewha Women's University. At the beginning of the street is a street side food stall selling grilled chicken skewers and fish cake soup. A unique feature of her stall is that there is a crab shell sitting atop her spicy fish cake soup. Her chicken skewers are the best. The spicy seafood soup with fishcake is great too. Try it!!

Other note-worthy food:
- __Gobong Ginseng Chicken Soup__: If you're lazy to queue for Tosokchon, try this! The soup has a different texture (creamier), also comes with a shot of ginseng. Best of all, in Myeongdong!
See: https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/517161245/

- __Innisfree Fluffy Pancakes__: I know, strange recommendation but it's a good breakfast! It's in Myeongdong, the biggest Innisfree store with a cafe on the second floor.

- __Yoogane__: You can find this everywhere. Tastes much better in Korea than in Singapore!!

- __Noryangjin Seafood Market__: we got a crab, abalone, raw octopus and scallops, from the new market, from the store directly facing the downward moving escalator, on the first floor. Her partner restaurant seems quite popular too (lucky us!)

- __Goraesa Fish Cake__: At Shinsegae Central City food hall, try the fish cake! It's yummy


Those that I didn't try but heard was good:
- __Eggdrop__: Try it if you are at Sinchon station!!
- __Pro Soy Crab__: Marinated soy sauce crab, too expensive for me :(
- __Joseon Kimbap__: Kimbap! Was renovating when we were there in Oct 2018


Decent food we ate but nothing to shout about:
- __Bonjuk__: Porridge for breakfast
- __Isaac Toast__: Toast for breakfast
- __Paris Baguette__: Bread for breakfast
- __Tous Les Jours__: Bread for breakfast
- __Eomeonijip Seafood Stew__: Seafood soup in Myeongdong if you really want to try it and have no time to travel out. Somewhat decent but slightly overpriced I feel.


To avoid:
- __Eight Colour BBQ, aka Palsaik BBQ at Sinchon__: Poor quality pork, extremely touristy. Only if you're going for quantity over quality. Even then, I'd advise to go elsewhere. It used to be good, but I guess standards have really dropped.

__Beyond food - eyelash extensions!__

If you want to do eyelash extensions in Seoul, try __Urbane.D__, she speaks english, and is really nice! It's at Ewha Women's University. Take Exit 5, turn left once you come out, turn right at the first lane, and you should see a banner on the ground floor. It is in the same location as a tanning studio.  Costs 50,000 won to do black lashes, 60,000 won for dark brown or brown lashes. It was my first time doing extensions, she was great and it didn't hurt one bit. I did a JC curl, 9-11mm. Email her for an appointment in advance, at zicoco0826@naver.com. You can also check our their instagram: https://www.instagram.com/urbane_d/

After that, buy mascara combs at Daiso for just 1,000won! You'd be surprised how many comestic shops I had to comb through (pun intended lol) to no avail, until I went into Daiso and got 8 combs!!
