Prepping up for my trip to Shanghai next week!! Now people might think that I am crazy for going during China's Golden Week (nope I had absolutely no clue before I booked my tickets - moral of the story is to CHECK BEFOREHAND) but we are just going to wing it. No other choice anyway... haha

Again, not much techy stuff but here goes my feeble attempt:

### Apps you should download before going to China

__1) VPN__

So that you can remain connected to the outside world (i.e. scale the Great FireWall of China) - check out this list of VPNs: https://www.helloteacher.asia/blog/best-vpn-for-china

Seems like ExpressVPN is recommended!

__2) Baidu Maps__

Because Google Maps doesn't work well in China apparently. Download it NOW.

__3) Didi Chuxing (滴滴出行)__

So you can actually hail a cab (it's like Uber apparently):

__4) WeChat (Pay)__ 

A chat app, but also used for payments! Now I have never tried paying using WeChat Pay... shall see what happens in China *gulps* 

Also a gentle reminder - if you have not opened your WeChat in like a million years (6 months?) please just open it once to check LOL apparently my account got locked out/hacked and I had to get a friend (who is a trusted and regular user of WeChat) to verify my account before it can be unlocked...!

__5) Da Zhong Dian Ping (大众点评)__

If you can read Mandarin, download this NOW. it's like the best thing ever.

It's like chope, burpple, food blogs all mashed into one!

Find the recommended food places, entertainment spots, etc and you can also book using the app!

Amazing stuff - my friend says like all Chinese have this app. like, all of them. LOL

__Bonus: E le mah (饿了吗)__

Food delivery app! Apparently really good (I assume it's like GrabFood?) Also only in Mandarin sadly lol

This seems to be the website but why can't I load it...?

Also they requested to verify my phone number but I can't using my Singapore number T.T

Oh wells... maybe have to get the hotel concierge to help call delivery for us instead LOL

Speaking of delivery: __TAOBAO__

Is like, the king. If you are ok with bumbling around in Mandarin on the app, just like use it. NOW.

Before, I used to default to Ezbuy or Lazada because I was worried about the delivery to Singapore and all.

FORGET ALL THAT. NOW.

Taobao has brought their game to a whole a new level. So easy just to set your delivery location to Singapore and pay using Visa.

Prices are cheaper compared to Ezbuy, and even AliExpress ANDDDD this is the clincher: the image search is crazy powerful. Like, crazy.

You don't even need to know what your item is called in Mandarin - just snap a picture of it, and search using their image search function.

BOOM.

Also, their recommendations are pretty sick. The only downside is I spend a million years obsessing over all the pages and I get sucked into this never ending spiral of more, more, moreee...!

Ok end of drama.

Honestly though, the most important thing is to look through the user reviews. Just click on the photos, and you can see what the item actually looks like. Like, legit, without filters and taken from ugly angles and all.

If it still looks decent, you know you can buy it. Lol

Ok end of my gushing. Back to Taobao-ing... LOL

Maybe I will do a review of my loots when they arrive. Haha
